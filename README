NAME
    watch - run commands when files change

SYNOPSIS
     watch <command> [--help]

DESCRIPTION
    "watch" is a program that watches for changes to files and directories
    then runs configured sets of commands.

    "watch" detects changes recursively from the current working directory.
    Commands and files and directories to ignore are read from the ".watch"
    file within the current working directory.

OPTIONS
    --help
        Print the help menu.

CONFIGURATION
  ignore
    The "ignore" section key.

    Keys within this section define additional file or directory names to
    ignore.

    Multiple file or directory names can be defined per line if separated by
    comma.

  command
    The "command" section key.

    Keys within this section define what command to run when that command
    argument is passed.

  EXAMPLES
    Automatically build and install a Perl module after editing
         # create a .watch configuration file in the directory to watch
         ~/git/bestpractical/bps/rt-extension-mandatoryontransition (add-config-verification) $ vi .watch
         [ignore]
         dirs=blib, tmp
         files=pm_to_blib, scratch

         [command]
         install=sudo make && sudo make install

         # start the watcher to run the commands defined within "install" on any file recursively within the cwd
         ~/git/bestpractical/bps/rt-extension-mandatoryontransition (add-config-verification) $ watch install
         [1617569718][ignore]: blib,tmp

         [1617569718][watch]: /home/blaine/git/bestpractical/bps/rt-extension-mandatoryontransition

         # after modifying the file, MandatoryOnTransition.pm, the "install" command is run
