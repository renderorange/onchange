NAME
    watch - run commands when files change

SYNOPSIS
     watch [--run <command>]
           [--help]

DESCRIPTION
    "watch" is a program that watches for changes to files and directories
    then runs configured sets of commands.

    "watch" detects changes recursively within the current working
    directory. Files/directories to ignore and commands to run are read from
    the ".watch" file within the current working directory.

OPTIONS
    --run <command>
        Defines which commands to run on changes.

        The "command" specified must be defined in the ".watch"
        configuration file.

        Multiple "--run" options may be defined.

    --help
        Print the help menu.

CONFIGURATION
  ignore
    The "ignore" section key.

    Keys within this section define additional file or directory names to
    ignore.

    Multiple file or directory names can be defined per line if separated by
    comma.

     [ignore]
     dirs=tmp, t
     files=scratch, testing

  command
    The "command" section key.

    Keys within this section define what command to run when that command
    argument is passed.

     [command]
     example=echo 'this is an example command'
     another_example=echo 'this is another example command'

    Defined commands are run as arguments to "watch". Multiple commands are
    run in the order they're passed.

     $ watch --run example --run another_example
     (will run example, then another_example)

  EXAMPLES
   Run two specific commands when changes are detected
     # create a .watch file in the directory to watch
     ~/git/example $ vi .watch
     [ignore]
     dirs=tmp, t
     files=scratch, testing

     [command]
     example=echo 'this is an example command'
     another_example=echo 'this is another example command'
     yet_another_example=echo 'this is yet another example command'

     # run watch, specifying both commands to run as defined in the .watch file
      ~/git/example $ watch --run example --run another_example
     [1617588530][ignore]: scratch,testing
     [1617588530][ignore]: tmp,t
     [1617588530][watch]: /home/blaine/git/example

     # when any non-ignored files or directories change (or new are created),
     # each of the specified commands are run (but not the yet_another_example command)

     [1617588661][modify]: /home/blaine/git/example/lib/example.pm

     this is an example command
     [1617588661][run another_example]: echo 'this is another example command'
     this is another example command
     [1617588707][create]: /home/blaine/git/example/puppies
     [1617588707][run example]: echo 'this is an example command'
     this is an example command
     [1617588707][run another_example]: echo 'this is another example command'
